# Recipe Website - HTML Practice Project

## About This Project

This is a beginner HTML project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum. The goal is to practice and reinforce fundamental HTML concepts by building a simple recipe website.

## Project Description

A basic recipe website consisting of:
- A main index page
- Multiple recipe pages
- Links connecting the pages together

**Note:** This project focuses solely on HTML structure. CSS styling will be added in a future iteration of the project.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, I practiced:
- HTML document structure
- Heading elements (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.)
- Paragraph and text formatting
- Lists (ordered and unordered)
